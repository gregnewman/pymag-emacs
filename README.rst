subversion and curl installed on your system.  The installer 
script has been tested on Mac OS X and Ubuntu 9.04.  It is not 
expected to work in a Windows environment.

Clone this repository and run the installer script:

..

  ./install.sh

Symlink the cloned repository into your home directory:

..

  ln -s /path/to/pymag-emacs ~/.emacs.d
